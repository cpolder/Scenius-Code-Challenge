# Scenius Code Test Starter Pack

This repository contains an initial starting point for developing your code-test application, as scaffolding the application is not a part of the challenge. It contains the following directories:

| Directory | Contents |
| --------- | -------- |
| Scenius.CodeTest.Solution | An empty solution with two applications in C# |
| Scenius.CodeTest.UI | A scaffolded Angular project |
| Scenius.CodeTest.Docker | Empty directory to store your Dockerfiles in |

You may decide yourself what to keep. You are not required to use any of these sources in your implementation.
